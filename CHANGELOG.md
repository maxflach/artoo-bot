# Changelog

## v0.5 — 2026-02-22

### Added
- **System secrets** — admin can provision API keys shared across all users with `/secret set --system <name> <value> --skill <skill>`; stored as `user_id=0` in the database
- **Full secret priority chain** — system (lowest) → user global → user project (highest); more specific values always win
- **`/secret del --system`** — admin can remove system secrets
- **`/secret list`** shows system secrets to the admin alongside their own

### Changed
- Secret merge query updated to include `user_id=0` rows in a single pass with correct priority ordering

---

## v0.4 — 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Secrets vault** — store named credentials encrypted at rest in SQLite; secrets are injected as `ARTOO_SECRET_*` env vars when skills run, never passed to Claude
- **AES-256-GCM encryption** — each secret value encrypted with a random nonce; 32-byte master key generated once and stored at `~/.config/bot/<instance>/secrets.key` (mode 0600); key is never in the database
- **Skill-locked secrets** — `--skill <name>` required on every `/secret set`; a secret can only be injected into the specific skill it was locked to — no other skill can access it, even in the same project
- **Secret scoping** — secrets are either project-scoped (default) or global (`--global`); global secrets are available across all your projects, project-scoped ones only in their project; project values override global ones for the same key name
- **`ARTOO_WD` env var** — skills receive their current working directory; files written there are auto-detected and sent back to the user
- **Auto file delivery for skills** — after a skill runs, any new files in the working directory are sent via Telegram; images (PNG/JPG) sent as photos, everything else as documents
- **`/secret` command** — full CRUD for secrets: `set`, `list`, `del`; values are never shown in responses, only key names
- **Demo skill: `imagine`** — generates images via Google Gemini Imagen API; saves PNG to working dir, bot sends it as a photo; requires `/secret set GEMINI_API_KEY <key> --skill imagine`; installed automatically by `install.sh`

### Changed
- `dispatchSkill()` now accepts an `extraEnv map[string]string` for secret injection into script skills
- `runSkill()` now snapshots the working directory before execution and sends any new files after

---

## v0.3 — 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Skills system** — drop `.md` prompt templates or executable files (or folders with `run.sh`) into a `skills/` directory to create custom `/commands`; no code changes needed
- **Skill locations** searched in order: global (`~/.config/bot/skills/`), per-instance (`~/.config/bot/<instance>/skills/`), per-project (`<project>/skills/`); later entries override earlier
- **Folder-based skills** — a skill folder can bundle data files alongside its entrypoint (e.g. `dadjoke/run.sh` + `dadjoke/jokes.json`)
- **`/skills`** — list all loaded skills with type and description
- **`/skills reload`** — reload skills from disk without restarting the bot (admin only)
- **MCP server** — skills exposed as MCP tools on the existing API server (`/mcp/sse`, `/mcp/message`); Claude can call them mid-task via JSON-RPC 2.0 over SSE
- **Auto-registration** — on startup, artoo writes its MCP server entry to `~/.claude.json` with a dedicated `artoo-mcp` API key (skips if already configured)
- **Skills in system prompt** — available skills listed in Claude's context so it's aware of them even without MCP
- **Demo skill: `dadjoke`** — folder-based script skill bundled with `jokes.json`; installed automatically by `install.sh`

---

## v0.2 — 2026-02-22

### Added
- **REST API** — HTTP server with Bearer token auth; trigger messages and run tasks from scripts or other services
- **API key management** — `/apikey new`, `/apikeys`, `/apikey revoke` (admin only)
- **User approval** — admin receives Approve/Deny buttons when an unknown user messages the bot
- **Session persistence** — active project survives bot restarts (stored in SQLite)
- **Project listing** — `/project list` shows all projects with README titles and active marker
- **Natural language scheduling** — `every day 08:00`, `every weekday`, `every monday`, `in 2h`, `tomorrow 18:00`, etc.
- **One-shot reminders** — `/at` command; schedules auto-delete after firing
- **Configurable backend** — swap between `claude-code`, `opencode`, or any agentic CLI via config
- **Interactive setup wizard** — `./artoo --setup` walks through all configuration in five steps
- **Multi-OS install script** — `install.sh` auto-detects macOS (LaunchAgent) and Linux (systemd)
- **One-liner installer** — `get.sh` downloads the correct binary for your platform from the latest release
- **Per-user isolation** — each user gets their own projects, memory, files, schedules, and working directory
- **Inline schedule management** — `/schedules` shows remove buttons per entry
- **Immediate ack messages** — bot replies instantly before the task completes, showing active project name
- **Source reorganised** — Go source moved into `src/` subfolder

### Changed
- Config section renamed from `claude` to `backend` to reflect support for multiple CLI tools
- `newMemoryStore` no longer takes a binary path; memory extraction uses a configurable runner
- Help text and replies use "project" consistently instead of "workspace"
